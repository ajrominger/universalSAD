The negative binomial distribution is highly flexible and seems likely to fit almost all abundance data.  It therefore has emperical universality.  I would like to show mechanistically that it derives from universal priciples as well.  To do this I aim to derive it from maximum entropy priciples but also from birth-death processes. In the later case the negative binomial emerges naturally from the mixture of a Poisson by a Gamma.  Poisson follows naturally from a birth-death process and the Gamma mixture recalls super-statistics.  We'll see if the derivations make any sense!
